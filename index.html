        <h1>BTS - Bangton Boys</h1>
        <p> BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan; lit. Bulletproof Boy Scouts), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is
            a South Korean boy band formed in 2010. The band consists of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook,
            who co-write or co-produce much of their material. Originally a hip hop group, they expanded their musical
            style to incorporate a wide range of genres, while their lyrics have focused on subjects including mental
            health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love,
            individualism, and the consequences of fame and recognition. Their discography and adjacent work has also
            referenced literature, philosophy and psychology, and includes an alternate universe storyline.</p>
        <p> BTS was formed in 2010, after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang Si-hyuk wanted to form a hip hop group around
            RM (Kim Nam-joon), an underground rapper well known on the music scene in Seoul. At the time, physical album
            sales were on the decline and digital revenues were not yet high enough to compensate.[8] Seeing a need for
            diversified income streams, Bang decided to form an idol group instead, because of the potential for live
            concert performances and passionate support from fans of such groups. Many trainees refused to become part
            of an idol group, but J-Hope, RM, and Suga remained.[8] Bang chose to vary from the usual, highly regimented
            idol groups and create one where the members would be individuals rather than an ensemble and free to
            express themselves.[9][10] Auditions were held in 2010 with plans to launch the following year.[11][12] The
            band members lived together, practicing up to 15 hours a day, and first performed before a small crowd of
            industry insiders in 2013.</p>
        <p> BTS's representation by Big Hit, rather than one of the three agencies that dominated K-pop at the time,
            allowed the individual members leeway to express their individuality and have input into the music.[15] On
            June 12, 2013, BTS released their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, along with the lead single "No More
            Dream", neither of which sold particularly well at the time.[16] On June 13, 2013, BTS made their stage
            debut on M Countdown with the single, "No More Dream".[17] Nevertheless, according to Kathy Sprinkel in her
            book on BTS, that single was "spotlighting young people's anxiety in the face of lofty parental
            expectations, sent shock waves through the K-pop ranks. Here was a musical act that wasn't pulling any
            punches. More specifically, they had a point of view, and they weren't afraid to take on topics that are
            considered taboo in South Korean society and elsewhere."[18] The album reached the top five on South Korea's
            Gaon Music Chart.[19] In 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS employed an old-school hip-hop sound from the 1990s.[20][21]
            The album's release was followed by appearances on Korean music shows, which caught the attention of
            reviewers and viewers.</p>
        <h2>Diplomacy</h2>
        <p> In his 1990 essay Soft Power, political scientist Joseph Nye developed the concept of a second type of power
            different from traditional authoritarianism.[350] Nye wrote, "This second aspect of power – which occurs
            when one country gets other countries to want what it wants – might be called co-optive or soft power in
            contrast with the hard or command power of ordering others to do what it wants."[351]. Researchers such as
            Maud Quessard have applied the concept of soft power to BTS and their influence on entertainment diplomacy
            and international relations.[352] Youna Kim and Maud Quessard all read the currency of soft power as
            including culture, political values, and foreign policy, which applies to BTS's ability to be co-optive in
            their approach to spreading their message of harmony, acceptance, and addressing life's setbacks via their
            broad appeal on the international stage.</p>
        <h2>Fandom</h2>
        <p>According to Kyung Hyun Kim, BTS's rise was facilitated by a great increase in music video programming and
            consumption on YouTube and the coming of an idol empire, including merchandising of nonmusical products,
            games, and fantasy fiction, as well as an expansion of online music fandom.[364] The group has a large,
            highly organized, online community of fans known as ARMY (Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth), which
            translates the group's lyrics and social media posts into other languages and matches charitable
            contributions of BTS's members. As of 2020, some 40 million ARMY members subscribe to the band's YouTube
            channel, with more than 30 million following the official BTS Twitter and Instagram accounts.[83] The fan
            community helps generate BTS's number-one chart rankings via coordinated campaigns on streaming
            platforms,[365] as well as pushes to feature BTS's music on radio stations and television.[366] Some ARMY
            members may even surpass the group itself in influence among BTS fans.</p>
        <p>BTS interacted and engaged with their followers from their earliest days via social media,as well as
            via BTS Universe, an alternate storyline involving the members told through music videos, mobile games,
            books, short films, and more that gives fans room to theorize. Kim suggested that ARMY are drawn to BTS
            since the members are seen as underdogs, originating from the Korean countryside and a relatively minor
            Korean entertainment company, which allows young fans to identify with them.BTS's lyrics speak to
            social values, and fans respond by trying to improve the world. As a result, the fandom regularly embraces
            activism on charitable causes and socio-political issues such as refugee crises, racial discrimination,
            children's rights, climate change, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
